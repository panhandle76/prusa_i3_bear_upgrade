Using our proven Semitec 104GT thermistors, which are then potted into a cylindrical copper cartridge with a high conductivity ceramic based adhesive. The legs are insulated with fibreglass sleeving, and terminated with a Molex Microfit 3.0 connector. This makes it particularly easy to disconnect your entire HotEnd without the need for re-wiring, especially when used with our high-precision heater cartridges.
